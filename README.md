This repository explores topic modeling techniques to analyze the evolution of topics in the annual 10-K filings of four major technology companies—Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Meta—spanning 2017 to 2023.

## Objective

The primary goal of this analysis is to investigate the following hypotheses:

- How have the topics discussed in the 10-K filings evolved before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic?
- Has there been a significant increase in the discussion of AI-related topics in the 10-K filings from 2017 to 2023?


## Approach

Two state-of-the-art topic modeling methods are utilized:

- **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)**: A probabilistic method used to identify topic distributions in textual data.
- **BERTopic**: A transformer-based approach leveraging embeddings for improved topic coherence and granularity.
By leveraging these complementary methodologies, the study ensures robust analysis and insightful comparisons.


This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for each company (Google, Microsoft, Apple, Meta) for streamlined and reproducible experimentation.
